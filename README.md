# discord-user-bot

A chatbot for the popular messaging app Discord designed to learn from messages sent in your server
and respond like a server member! The discord-user-bot (DUB) is implemented by a Markov model that
employs unsupervised online learning by the continuous stream of messages in your server and
predicts a sequence of words by the trained probability distributions.
